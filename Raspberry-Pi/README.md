#**Raspberry Pi Codes Breakdown**
- The Raspberry Pi acts as the server that contains the database to store all of the readings obtained by the ESP32.
Through php scripts I am able to post the incomming readings to the database and display them in a webpage for data
visualization. To make this project more secure I have added a layer of protection based on user authentication.

##**MySQL Scripts**
-These scripts manage the posting of the readings to the database and displaying the data on the web page.
